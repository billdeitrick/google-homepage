# Google Homepage Project

This is the "HTML/CSS" project from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

This was a useful exercise for learning more about Grid and Flexbox layouts. Google uses primarily absolute positioning in their code as of this writing. Colors, gradients, and box-shadows were lifted directly from Google's live home page so they would be an exact match.
