# Google Homepage Project

This is the "HTML/CSS" project from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

This was a useful exercise for learning more about Grid and Flexbox layouts. All code is my own, except for colors, gradients, and shadows (which were copied from the live Google homepage so they would match exactly).
